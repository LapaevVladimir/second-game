# second-game
This is my second project in C++ and in general. This is a console game with some character customization. 
There are only 2 levels available in the game. To complete the level, the player needs to collect 3 coins, after which a portal will open. 
The second level contains not a big trick).
### To navigate the menu, use the arrows, as well as to move the character.
